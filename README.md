# Donâ€™t bind yourself to do notation!

This repository contains the language specification, refactoring, and proofs
related to the refactoring of `do` blocks to the `>>=` operator.

This repository contains the code and proofs written as part of my
[Research Project at the TU Delft](https://github.com/TU-Delft-CSE/Research-Project) in Q4 of 2022-2023.
A high level overview of this project can be found in my
BSc thesis [on the TU Delft repository](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:e4c7d17f-b4c7-48ac-b1e6-834d82c26dc3)
